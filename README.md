# Diwali Sales Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of sales data collected during the Diwali festival. The dataset includes information about customers' demographics, purchase behavior, and product preferences. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset, named "Diwali Sales Data.csv", contains the following columns:

- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Age Group**: Age group of the customer.
- **State**: State from which the order was placed.
- **Marital_Status**: Marital status of the customer.

- **Product_Category**: Category of the purchased product.
- **Product_ID**: ID of the purchased product.
- **Orders**: Number of orders placed.
- **Amount**: Total amount spent on purchases.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Removed irrelevant or empty columns.
   - Checked for and dropped null values.
   - Converted the data type of the 'Amount' column to integer.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed the distribution of customers by gender, age group, state, marital status, occupation, and product category.
   - Visualized the relationships between various features and the total amount spent on purchases.
   - Identified key insights and trends from the visualizations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarized the findings from the EDA.
   - Highlighted the target demographic and their preferences based on the analysis.
